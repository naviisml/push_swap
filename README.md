# push_swap

This project will sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. For this project, you have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Requirements

- gcc
- make

## Commands

To build the program in the final stage, the `all` rule as followed in a terminal;
```
make all
```

To build the final script, and run it after compilation, you may use the `dev` command used as followed in a terminal;
```
make dev
```

To clean up the `objects/` files and folder, you can use the `clean` command as followed in a terminal;
```
make clean
```

To remove both the `objects/` files, the `build` files and the compiled program file, you can simply use the `fclean` command as followed in a terminal;
```
make fclean
```
